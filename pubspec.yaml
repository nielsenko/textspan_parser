  A package to create TextSpans from a textual representation.
  The typical use case is to allow text styling to be determined 
  by the translator when localizing an app.

  Example:
  en-US: Unfortunately, my {\italic neighbor} had eaten my shoes.
  da: DesvÃ¦rre havde min {\italic nabo} spist mine sko.

  Notice how neighbor (= nabo) and had (= havde) are reversed in 
  danish (da), compared to american english (en-US). This implies 
  that if we want "neighbor" to appear in italic, we need to decide
  where the text should be split in spans during translation.
